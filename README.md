# DockerizedRaspberryPi
Docker for a pi suite

this repo is my current Raspberry Pi configuration.
It provides the clean installation of:
 - a nextcloud for personnal files sharing and management
 - a home assistant installation as an existing interface for all the zigbee domotic
 - a z2m folder which installs everything needed to use zigbee to mqtt as a broker for your zigbee installation
 - a nginx proxy manager as a reverse proxy in order to manage the external accesses to your installation through the 443 port (https). 
   It also includes a web UI which helps to configure nginx without needing to go through config files.
